Highly recommend you try and solve it for yourself -- it's very satisfying -- but there is a solution available [here](./Counterfeit_coin_riddle_SOLUTION.pdf).

My solution is slightly different (and I think more straightforward) to the one described in the above video, and provides the algorithm followed by this simulation program.
