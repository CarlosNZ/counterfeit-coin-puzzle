Highly recommend you try and solve it for yourself -- it's very satisfying -- but there is a solution available [here](./solution/Counterfeit_coin_riddle_SOLUTION.pdf).

My solution is slightly different (and I think more straightforward) to the one described in the above video, and provides the algorithm followed by this simulation program.

Program output for all possible situations can be viewed [here](./solution/Full_solution_output.txt)
