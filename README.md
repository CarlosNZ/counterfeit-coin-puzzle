Highly recommend you try and solve it for yourself -- it's very satisfying -- but my solution is available [here](./solution/Counterfeit_coin_riddle_SOLUTION.pdf).

My solution is slightly different (and I think more straightforward) to the one in the above video, and is the basis for this simulation script.

Program output for all possible situations can be viewed [here](./solution/Full_solution_output.txt).
