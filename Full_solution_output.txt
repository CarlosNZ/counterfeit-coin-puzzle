TRIAL 1
--------

> Weighing #1
Checking coins [1, 2, 3, 4] (Left) against coins [5, 6, 7, 8] (Right)...

> Weighing #2
Checking coins [1, 2, 6] (Left) against coins [3, 4, 5] (Right)...

since the scale tipped the same way.

Checking coins [1] (Left) against coins [2] (Right)...
Right side is heavier 
The fake coin will be the one that caused the scale to tip in the direction consistent with the second weighing.
